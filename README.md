# THE ULTIMATE PETS API

## Why?

I'm currently coding this API to learn some concepts about developing APIs in Typescript. The goal is to have an API with some useful functionalities about adopting pets; like posting a pet for adoption, adopting a pet for someone, search for pets by species and genre and some other cool stuff.

## Nice, but what is this developed on?

I am actually using using Node, Typescript, Express and TypeORM for developing this API. For the database, I'm using MongoDB and, for writing tests, I will be using Vitest. For last, Swagger is used to make a documentation about this API.
Besides that, the API is coded using TDD and SOLID principles, trying to make a decoupled and testable code.

## How can I run this API?

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
